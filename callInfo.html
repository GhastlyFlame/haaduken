	<p>27 calls to a duty phone in 3 days is absurd, please stop</p>
	<p>If I had a nickel for every duty phone call I've had, I could pay tuition for all 4 years<br><br>Throwback to the time I locked myself out while being on duty, so I called the duty phone from my phone, waited about 10 seconds, heard the duty phone ring, hung up my phone and picked up the duty phone. My idiocity knows no limits.<br>There was another time I was doing rounds, and happened to get a call that some suspicious person was going through the building floor by floor, looking down every hallway, dressed in all black, and had a backpack. The caller mentioned he was tailing the guy. So I turned around and pointed to my nametag.</p>
	<p>How did this happen~!</p>
